# Modeling_Earthquake_Damage

## Objective
The dataset comes from the Driven Data competition, Richter's Predictor: Modeling Earthquake Damage. 
https://www.drivendata.org/competitions/57/nepal-earthquake/page/134/

The data provides aspects of the buildings that were damaged by the 2015 earthquake in Nepal and the geographic region of those buildings. The objective is to predict the level of damage to buildings hit by the earthquake. The level damage is represented by 3 levels; 1 represents low damage, 2 represents a medium amount of damage, and 3 represents almost complete
destruction.

## Motivation
Natural disasters are unpreventable, we can try and predict when the disasters will happen, but can't stop them. Therefore, we need to focus on ways to reduce the destruction that natural disasters will cause. The dataset for this project was collected through surveys by the Central Bureau of Statistics and is one of the largest post-disaster datasets ever collected. Being able to predict the level of damage could help design optimal building structures that would then reduce damage, and possibly save lives, from future earthquakes.
